Despite being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-rubio-idUSKCN0VB0F5" target="_blank">the establishment's favorite</a>, Marco Rubio is trailing in the ongoing Republican race. He has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html" target="_blank">only 151 delegates</a>, compared to Trump's 384 and Cruz's 300. But he is determined to stay until the end, and he has a massive fundraising operation to do so.

It received over 33 million in contributions between April 2015 (when Rubio <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/us/politics/marco-rubio-2016-presidential-campaign.html" target="_blank">announced his campaign</a>) until January 2016 (the latest data available), according to filings with the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=C00458844&amp;tabIndex=1" target="_blank">Federal Election Commission</a>.

But where does the money come from? What states support Rubio most? And what time of the year was the most successful for the senator from the Sunshine State?

78% of all the contributions listed by the FEC include specific information about the individual donors. Of the rest, most fall under the $ 200-limit, where it's not mandatory to include the donor's information.

Rubio’s campaign committee received the most money from his home state <strong>Florida</strong> - over 5.5 million dollars. <strong>California</strong> comes in second place, with 4.6 million dollars. <strong>North Dakota</strong> is the state that donated least to the Rubio campaign, only 11,298 dollars.

The picture changes when we take a look at the individual donations: <strong>Montana</strong> is the state with the highest average donation – $ 897.70 per contributor. On the contrary, in <strong>Alaska</strong> an average donation was only $ 132.60, which makes it the state with the lowest average.

When we take a look at the total number of people who donated to Rubio's campaign between April and January, <strong>Florida</strong> is the winner once again. 13,131 people donated to their home senator in the Sunshine State. <strong>North Dakota </strong>comes in last, with only 44 people donating to Rubio.

On average, "Marco Rubio For President" received 2.76 millons dollars per month.

The most successful month for his campaign committee was <strong>December 2015,</strong> when the Florida senator received over six million dollars in contributions. Within December, the most successful day for Rubio's committee was the 15th, the day of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/13/politics/republican-debate-gop-stage/index.html" target="_blank">the last Republican Debate</a> of the year.

Looking forward, Rubio has his eyes focused on Florida, a winner-takes-all state. A<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/07/politics/florida-poll-donald-trump-marco-rubio/" target="_blank"> recent poll </a>has Donald Trump leading Rubio in the Sunshine State. But as described above, most of Rubio's contributions come from his home state, which can be seen as a promising sign.
